To solve this issue, avoid using `!important`.  Instead, refactor your CSS to ensure specificity resolves the style conflict.  For example, if you want the `.parent .child` selector to have precedence, ensure that its specificity is higher than the `.child` selector without using `!important`. This might involve using more specific selectors or more classes:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red; /* Removed !important */
}

.parent .child.special {
  color: green;
}
```

Here we've added a `special` class to the child element when it needs to have the green color, making it more specific, and removing the `!important` declaration, which makes the CSS cleaner and easier to maintain.  Other strategies to achieve the same effect might include restructuring the HTML or CSS to better reflect the desired styling.
