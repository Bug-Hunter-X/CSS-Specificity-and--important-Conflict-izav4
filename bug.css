The following CSS code has an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

The unexpected behavior is that the `.parent .child` selector does not override the `!important` declaration in `.child`.  The `!important` declaration has higher precedence, even though `.parent .child` is more specific.
